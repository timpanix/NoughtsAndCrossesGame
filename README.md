NoughtsAndCrossesGame
=====================

This is my version of the Noughts and Crosses game (also known as Tic Tac Toe). Dies ist meine Version des allgemein bekannten Spiels "Nullen oder Kreuze".

The program consists of three java classes:

- NaCGame: the actual game.

- NaCManager: this class contains the main method and is in charge of running the game.

- Player: this class is used to store information about the players: name, "colour" (X or 0) and the number of wins for each player.

The program allows the same players to play more than one game.

I created this game for fun. Enjoy! :-)
